# HTML5 Musings #

This is a series of html5 projects.  Master branch is meant to be a blank slate that will serve up a web app that has a canvas but nothing else.  All futher experiments will be dedicated to their own branches.

* A lot of these will be me playing with the code from <a href="http://seb.ly/2009/09/simple-3d-in-html5-canvas/">here</a>.

* All experiments will be done in Node.js.

Install prerequisites:

    $ npm install

To start app server:

    $ node app
    
Enjoy!
